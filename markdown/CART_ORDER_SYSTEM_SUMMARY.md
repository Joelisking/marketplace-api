## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Database Schema

- ✅ **CartItem Model**: User-product relationships with quantities
- ✅ **Order Model**: Complete order lifecycle management
- ✅ **OrderItem Model**: Order-product relationships with totals
- ✅ **InventoryLog Model**: Stock change tracking
- ✅ **Enhanced Relationships**: Proper foreign key constraints

### API Endpoints

- ✅ **Cart Routes**: `/cart/items`, `/cart` (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- ✅ **Order Routes**: `/orders`, `/vendor/orders` (CRUD operations)
- ✅ **Schema Validation**: Zod schemas for all endpoints
- ✅ **Authentication**: JWT-based security
- ✅ **Rate Limiting**: API protection

### Business Logic

- ✅ **Price Calculations**: Subtotal, tax (7.5% VAT), shipping, total
- ✅ **Inventory Validation**: Real-time stock checks
- ✅ **Order Status Workflow**: PENDING → PROCESSING → SHIPPED → DELIVERED
- ✅ **Database Transactions**: Data consistency
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Comprehensive validation
